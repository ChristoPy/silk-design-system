# Colors
The colors list are (until now) a collection of essencial colors to be used in a UI.

# Naming
Naming colors follows rules to improve the ease of use.

The convention is simple, to add a color, a class of the same name should be added to an element.

The key difference is how to specify if the color is being applied to the background or the text, and that's when the convention is used.

To change the background:  
```css
.blue
```

To change the text:
```css
.black-text
```
